## Hi, I'm Francesca Hall

I’m a certified data science graduate with 8+ years of experience in content creation, office management, and aviation operations. I recently completed a Data Science Bootcamp through TripleTen, where I built a predictive model to identify telecom customer churn using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn.

I bring a unique blend of technical skills and creative communication, with a passion for solving real-world problems through data. I'm especially interested in aviation, logistics, and digital operations where efficiency and accuracy are key.
