## Hi there 👋

I'm an aspiring data scientist passionate about leveraging data to drive business growth and enhance my technical skills. Currently, I’m studying data science with TripleTen and building a strong foundation in data analysis and machine learning.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a portfolio of data science projects to showcase my skills, learning Python and SQL to handle data efficiently, and exploring data visualization techniques to make insights more impactful.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, and fundamental data analysis techniques; how to use tools like Jupyter Notebook and libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib; and the basics of machine learning and its applications.
  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects that help businesses make data-driven decisions, open-source projects where I can contribute as a beginner and learn from others, and any projects involving beginner-friendly data tasks, data cleaning, or exploratory data analysis.
  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with gaining more hands-on experience with real-world data sets, improving my coding skills in Python and mastering popular data science libraries, and understanding machine learning algorithms and how to implement them effectively.
  
- 💬 Ask me about my journey into data science and what I’m currently learning. As a mother and a former social media manager, I bring creativity and analytical skills into my work. I'm also deeply passionate about aviation, and I’m currently diving into data science to broaden my technical expertise and drive business growth.
